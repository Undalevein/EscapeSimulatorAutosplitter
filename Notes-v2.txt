Notes:
v2
Comments:
1. Added SteamPunk DLC, not fully tested

v1
Comments:
1. Suggest adding 1 second delay to 1st split, player control is about 1 second after the 1st scene is "loaded"
2. Last split needs to be split manually until someone finds a way to identify the last level complete
3. Resets timer when you go back to Menu
4. There is somewhat of a load remover, so there will be some delta between REALTIME and GAME TIME. We should use Realtime until a more reliable load remover is found
