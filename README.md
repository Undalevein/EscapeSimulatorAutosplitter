# Escape Simulator AutoSplitter

### Motivations

As Escape Simulator gets more updates, loading times continue to get worse and worse. As someone who likes to speedrun this game during my leisure, I often lose time due to hardware differences and I would find myself not being able to compete for the world record for the IL leaderboards. This is especially compounded for coop runs.

This AutoSplitter is meant to address this issue by not only giving accurate split times for comparison, but to also remove loading times to make running Escape Simulator more accesssible to players.

### Installation

#### Automatic Installation with LiveSplit 
This is the recommended way of downloading the AutoSplitter, as it automatically downloads the latest version of the AutoSplitter if a new version is available. 

1. If you have not already done so, download the latest version of [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/downloads/). 
2. Open LiveSplit and right click your LiveSplit timer. Select "Edit Splits..."
3. Right of "Game Name:," type either "Escape Simulator" or "Escape Simulator 2" depending on the game you are running. After doing, you should see "Autostart, Autosplit, and loada removal available. (By Undalevein)" text.
4. Click on the "Activate" button.
5. To change your AutoSplitter settings, click on "Settings." There you can toggle any option depending on what you want!
6. That's it!

#### Manual Installation

1. If you have not already done so, download the latest version of [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/downloads/). 
2. Download the file `EscapeSimulator.asl` and the `Components` folder with the helper file and put somewhere in your computer. They should both be in the same directory. Copy the file location of the `.asl` file onto your clipboard.
3. Open Livesplit and right click your LiveSplit timer. Select "Edit Layout..."
4. Add a new component by clicking on the "+" button. Go to "Control" and add the "Scriptable Auto Splitter" component.
5. Select the added component. There, you can paste your file location into the "Script Path" textbox. Otherwise, you can click on "Browse" to select that asl file. 
6. Toggle the options like you would normally with an Auto Splitter.
7. Boot up the game and test it!


### Credit

This is a continuation on Jonc4's AutoSplitter that was made in the beginning, with the last update being the Steampunk update. With his work, I was able to fix some of the features he made, so I am grateful for his efforts.

## Disclaimers

Even though the AutoSplitter is robust in its current state, I won't be implementing the following features:
1. **VR** - I don't own Escape Simulator in VR, nor do I know how to configure one. Unless there are some demand, I may try, but this is something that is the bottom of the barrel in terms of priorities.
2. **Other Consoles** - My Mac is busted, and I don't think I will get another anytime soon. XBox, PlayStation, and other console versions I may not consider.

## Future Updates
This is depenedent on the popularity of *Escape Simulator* and *Escape Simulator 2* speedrunning in general. I will continue to update the game based on the community needs, but if not I will be updating based on the new official maps for either games.
